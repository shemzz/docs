## **The BELL Framework**

Mavera AI organizes the entire agent lifecycle around the **BELL** loop—**Build**, **Evaluate**, **Launch**, and **Learn**. This is the operating system behind every polished experience we deliver: a repeatable rhythm that helps teams move from idea to world-class conversations without losing speed or quality.

## **FAQ**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will the agent use the name I set in configuration?">
    Yes, the agent will use the name you configure in the agent settings. This name will be used when the agent introduces itself during conversations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the voice need to match the language?">
