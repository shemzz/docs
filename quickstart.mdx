## **Types of agents**

<Note>
  All agents are interactive voice agents designed for real-time conversations.
</Note>

There are three types of agents: outbound, inbound and widget.

### **Outbound agents**

Outbound agents reach out to customers first. You can use them to:

- Contact potential clients, cold calling, lead generation
- Remind clients about appointments, confirming meetings, following up on their feedback
- Conduct surveys, collect feedback, check in with your customers after they place an order

### **Inbound agents**

Inbound agents respond to incoming calls or messages, handling questions in real time. You can use them to:

- Provide customer support and troubleshooting help
- Help customers track their orders and update them on order statuses
- Route calls automatically

### **Widget agents**

Widget agents help users on your website. You can use them to:

- Provide live chat support, answering frequently asked questions
- Qualify leads, collecting information from potential clients
- Guide users through troubleshooting steps

### Create an agent

To create a new agent, go to the **Agents** tab. You have two options:

1. **Start from scratch**. This option allows the most customisation, and works best if you want to configure your agent yourself.
2. **Browse our templates**. This option allows you to browse from a selection of templates, and works best if you want a specific configuration that already exists.

### Start from scratch

1. On the agent creation page, click **Start from scratch**.
2. Choose your agent type (Outbound, Inbound, Widget).
3. Customise your new agent in the **Configuration** tab. If it’s an outbound agent, you’ll need to assign a phone number before you deploy it.
