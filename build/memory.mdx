## **Overview**

Memory allows your Mavera AI agent to remember information from conversations, maintain context, and provide personalized experiences. This guide covers how to configure and use memory in your agents.

![Memory Overview](/images/memory-overview-placeholder.png)

## **Types of Memory**

### **1. Conversation Memory**

Remembers information within a single conversation:
- Previous turns in the current conversation
- Context from earlier in the call
- Information mentioned by the user
- Agent's previous responses

**Use Case**: Maintaining context during a single phone call.

### **2. Long-term Memory**

Stores information across multiple conversations:
- User preferences
- Past interactions
- Customer history
- Persistent data

**Use Case**: Remembering customer information across multiple calls.

### **3. User Profiles**

Maintains user-specific information:
- Name and contact details
- Preferences and settings
- Account information
- Interaction history

**Use Case**: Personalizing experiences based on user data.

## **Configuring Memory**

### **Conversation Memory Settings**

Configure how much context to remember:

- **Context Window**: Number of conversation turns to remember
- **Variable Storage**: Which variables to store during conversation
- **Memory Duration**: How long to retain conversation context

### **Long-term Memory Settings**

Configure persistent memory:

- **Storage Type**: Database, API, or custom storage
- **Data Retention**: How long to keep long-term memory
- **Privacy Settings**: What data can be stored
- **Access Control**: Who can access stored data

## **Using Memory in Conversations**

### **Storing Information**

Store information during conversations:

```
User: "My name is John and I prefer morning appointments"
Agent: Stores:
  - user_name = "John"
  - appointment_preference = "morning"
```

### **Retrieving Information**

Retrieve stored information:

```
Agent: "Hello {user_name}, I see you prefer {appointment_preference} appointments. 
       Would you like to schedule one for tomorrow morning?"
```

### **Updating Information**

Update existing memory:

```
User: "Actually, I prefer afternoon appointments now"
Agent: Updates appointment_preference = "afternoon"
```

## **Memory Variables**

### **User Variables**

- Name, email, phone number
- Preferences and choices

Choose the right storage type:
- **Conversation Memory**: For temporary, call-specific data
- **Long-term Memory**: For persistent, user-specific data
- **User Profiles**: For personal information

### **5. Test Memory Behavior**

Test that memory works correctly:
- Verify information is stored
- Check retrieval accuracy
- Test memory updates
- Validate data persistence
