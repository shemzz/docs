## **Overview**

The Flow Designer is Mavera AI's visual interface for building sophisticated, multi-step conversation flows. It allows you to create predictable, reviewable conversation paths that your team can trust.

## **Getting Started**

### **When to Use Flow Designer**

Use Flow Designer when you need:
- Multi-step conversations with branching logic
- Conditional responses based on user input
- Integration with external systems at specific points
- Complex decision trees
- Predictable, reviewable conversation paths

### **Creating a Flow Designer Agent**

1. Navigate to **Create Agent**
2. Select **"Flow Designer Agent"**
3. You'll see the visual flow canvas

## **Core Concepts**

### **Nodes**

Nodes are the building blocks of your conversation flow:

- **Start Node**: The entry point of your conversation
- **Message Node**: Sends text to the user
- **Question Node**: Asks the user a question and captures their response
- **Condition Node**: Branches the flow based on conditions
- **Action Node**: Performs external actions (API calls, database queries, etc.)
- **End Node**: Concludes the conversation

![Node Types](/images/flow-designer-nodes-placeholder.png)

### **Connections**

Connect nodes to define the conversation path:
- Click and drag from a node's output to another node's input
- Connections represent the flow of conversation
- You can have multiple connections from a single node for branching

## **Building Your First Flow**

### **Step 1: Start Node**

Every flow begins with a Start Node:
- This is automatically created
- You can configure the initial greeting
- Set up initial variables if needed

### **Step 2: Add a Message Node**

1. Drag a **Message Node** onto the canvas
2. Connect it from the Start Node
3. Enter your greeting message:
   ```
   Hello! Thank you for calling. How can I help you today?
   ```

### **Step 3: Add a Question Node**

1. Add a **Question Node** after your greeting
2. Configure the question:
   - **Question Text**: "What would you like to do today?"
   - **Variable Name**: Store the response in a variable (e.g., `user_intent`)
   - **Validation**: Optional validation rules

### **Step 4: Add Conditional Logic**

1. Add a **Condition Node** after the question
2. Set up conditions based on the user's response:
   ```
   If user_intent contains "appointment" → Go to Appointment Flow
   If user_intent contains "information" → Go to Information Flow
   Otherwise → Go to General Help
   ```

### **Step 5: Add Actions (Optional)**

For each branch, you can add **Action Nodes**:
- Make API calls
- Query databases
- Send emails
- Update CRM systems

### **Step 6: End the Conversation**

Add **End Nodes** to conclude each conversation path:
- Thank the user
- Provide next steps
- Set follow-up actions if needed

## **Advanced Features**

### **Variables**

Use variables to store and reuse information:

- **User Variables**: Information collected from the user
- **System Variables**: Pre-defined system information
- **Custom Variables**: Variables you create and manage

**Example:**
```
Variable: customer_name
Value: Collected from Question Node "What's your name?"
Used in: "Thank you, {customer_name}, for calling today!"
```

### **Memory**

Configure memory to retain context:
- **Conversation Memory**: Remembers the current conversation
- **Long-term Memory**: Stores information across conversations
- **User Profiles**: Maintains user-specific data

### **Loops and Iterations**

Create loops for repetitive tasks:
- Ask multiple questions in sequence
- Process lists of items
- Retry failed actions

### **Error Handling**

Set up error handling:
- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Handle action failures gracefully
- **Fallback Messages**: Provide alternatives when actions fail
- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retry failed operations

## **Best Practices**

### **1. Keep Flows Simple**

- Break complex flows into smaller, manageable sections
- Use clear, descriptive node names
- Document your flow logic

### **2. Test Each Branch**

- Test every possible conversation path
- Verify conditional logic works correctly
- Check that variables are set and used properly

### **3. Use Meaningful Variable Names**

- Use descriptive names: `customer_name` not `var1`
- Follow a consistent naming convention
- Document variable purposes

### **4. Handle Edge Cases**

- Add default branches for unexpected responses
- Provide helpful error messages
- Include fallback options

### **5. Optimize for Performance**

- Minimize unnecessary API calls
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use efficient conditional logic

## **Integration Examples**

### **CRM Integration**

```
Start → Greeting → Question (Customer ID) → 
Action (Fetch CRM Data) → Message (Display Info) → End
```

### **Appointment Booking**

```
Start → Greeting → Question (Date Preference) → 
Question (Time Preference) → Action (Check Availability) → 
Condition (Available?) → Action (Book Appointment) → End
```

### **Support Ticket Creation**

```
Start → Greeting → Question (Issue Description) → 
Action (Create Ticket) → Message (Ticket Number) → End
```

## **Troubleshooting**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My flow isn't following the expected path">
    - Check your condition logic
    - Verify variable names match exactly
    - Review the conversation logs
    - Test each condition individually
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Variables aren't being set correctly">
    - Ensure variable names don't have spaces
    - Check that Question Nodes are properly configured
    - Verify variable scope (conversation vs. long-term)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Actions are failing">
    - Check API credentials and endpoints
    - Verify request formats
    - Review error logs
    - Test API calls outside the flow first
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I debug my flow?">
    - Use the simulation feature to test flows
    - Review execution logs for each node
    - Check variable values at each step
    - Use the debug mode for detailed information
  </Accordion>
