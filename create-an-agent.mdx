## **Step 3: Set Up Your Agent's Behavior**

### **For Single-Prompt Agents:**

Enter a clear, detailed prompt that describes:
- What your agent should do
- How it should interact with callers
- What information it should collect
- How it should handle different scenarios

**Example Prompt:**
```
You are a friendly customer service agent for a restaurant. 
Your role is to:
- Greet callers warmly
- Answer questions about menu items, hours, and location
- Take reservations for parties of 2 or more
- Provide directions to the restaurant
- Transfer urgent calls to a manager if needed

Always be polite, helpful, and concise. If you don't know something, 
honestly say so and offer to connect them with someone who can help.
```

### **For Flow Designer Agents:**

Use the visual flow designer to:
- Create conversation nodes
- Define decision points
- Set up actions and integrations
- Configure memory and context

## **Step 4: Add Knowledge Base (Optional)**

If your agent needs specific information:

1. Go to **Knowledge Base** section
2. Upload documents, add URLs, or enter text
3. Your agent will use this information to answer questions accurately

Customize how your agent sounds:

- **Voice Selection**: Choose from available voices
- **Speaking Rate**: Adjust how fast the agent speaks
- **Pitch**: Modify the voice pitch
- **Accent**: Select regional accent if available
