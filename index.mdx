## **The BELL Framework**

Mavera AI organizes the entire agent lifecycle around the **BELL** loop—**Build**, **Evaluate**, **Launch**, and **Learn**. This is the operating system behind every polished experience we deliver: a repeatable rhythm that helps teams move from idea to world-class conversations without losing speed or quality.
